# Data Science & Big Data Analytics (DSBDA)

This repository contains a structured collection of lab assignments and practical implementations from my third-year Computer Engineering curriculum. The projects focus on the full data lifecycle: from cleaning and exploratory analysis to distributed big data processing and machine learning.

## 📂 Repository Overview

The assignments are categorized into three major domains of modern data engineering:

### 1. Data Wrangling & EDA (Python)
* **Preprocessing:** Techniques for handling missing data, outliers, and data transformation using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Applying descriptive statistics to understand data distributions and variance.
* **Visualization:** Creating insightful charts (Box plots, Histograms, Scatter plots) using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

### 2. Big Data Ecosystem (Hadoop & Scala)
* **MapReduce:** Implementation of the WordCount algorithm to demonstrate distributed computing logic.
* **Scala Programming:** Functional programming approaches to data sorting and processing (e.g., Bubble Sort in Scala).
* **Environment:** Practical configuration and usage of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

### 3. Machine Learning & NLP
* **Classification:** Implementation of the **Naive Bayes** algorithm for predictive modeling.
* **Text Analysis:** Basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) including tokenization and frequency analysis.
